# Password Security Survey

## Summary

Weak and "shared" passwords are prevalent - even after hundreds of well-publicized global password breaches, "password" and "12345" remain the most popular passwords, and password re-use is common. Weak wifi passwords are specifically a challenge, as wifi signals often are accessible outside of an office's physical limits, but provide full access to the private network.


## Materials Needed

* A prepared Password Survey (given sensitivity and need for anonymity, consider printing and then shredding/burning).
* The Level Up Activity, [Password Reverse Race](https://level-up.cc/curriculum/protecting-data/creating-and-managing-strong-passwords/activity-discussion/password-reverse-race/) provides a staff activity.


## Walkthrough

Adapt this survey to get a sense of how passwords are used in the organization.  Anonymous paper surveys, later destroyed, are a good way to gather this information. The earlier questions are more important in terms of getting a sense of password practices, so consider adapting or shortening the survey based on staff/leadership buy-in and risk considerations.
